## Features ‚ú®

-   **Persistent UI Shell:** A stable three-column layout where the side panels for stats and the timer are always visible.
-   **Dynamic Content Area:** The central part of the screen dynamically switches between the login modal and the lab dashboard.
-   **Password Authentication:** Access is protected by a hardcoded password, with clear error messages for incorrect attempts.
-   **Session Timer:** Users are allocated a 60-minute session. The timer starts on login, pauses on exit, and resumes upon re-entry.
-   **Automatic Logout:** The session automatically terminates and returns to the login screen when the timer expires.
-   **State Preservation:** Remaining session time is preserved when a user exits and logs back in.
